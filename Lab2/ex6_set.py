ISCG6426 Lab 2 Semester 2 2020 by Kris Pritchard / @krisrp

Tests used to check correctness.
This file requires 'pytest' and 'pyexpect' to run.
Install them with the following command:
    pip install pytest pyexpect

Then run the file with:
    pytest -xv ex6_set_tests.py

You need to implement this code so that all of the tests pass.
Feel free to comment out specific tests, but only submit your answers files.
When checking your answers I will use the test files from this repository.

Set (No Duplicates / Unique Items Only / Mathematical Set):
    For this introductory lab you need to implement functionality for a basic set data structure.
    Performance doesn't matter for this.
    None of the method implementations require more than 7 lines of code.

# IMPLEMENT a SetException.


# IMPLEMENT a SetElementNotFoundException which inherits from SetException.


class Set:
    """
    Basic implementation of a set.
    Set must NOT contain duplicates.
    NOTE: You're not allowed to use Python's built-in set() for this. Sorry!
    If you use set() you will get 0 marks for this question.
    Hint: Use 'in' and 'not in' a lot.
