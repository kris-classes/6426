ISCG6426 Lab 2 Semester 2 2020 by Kris Pritchard / @krisrp

Tests used to check correctness.
This file requires 'pytest' and 'pyexpect' to run.
Install them with the following command:
    pip install pytest pyexpect

Then run the file with:
    pytest -xv ex5_dictionary_tests.py

You need to implement this code so that all of the tests pass.
Feel free to comment out specific tests, but only submit your answers files.
When checking your answers I will use the test files from this repository.


Naive Dictionary (Interface):
    For this introductory lab you need to implement functionality for a basic dictionary/hashmap data structure.
    Performance doesn't matter for this.
    None of the method implementations require more than 6 lines of code.

# IMPLEMENT a DictionaryException.


# IMPLEMENT a DictionaryKeyNotFoundException which inherits from DictionaryException.

    Basic silly implementation of a dictionary/hashtable.
    This is more to demonstrate how the interface of a dictionary behaves.
