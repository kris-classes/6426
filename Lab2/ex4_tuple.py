ISCG6426 Lab 2 Semester 2 2020 by Kris Pritchard / @krisrp

Tests used to check correctness.
This file requires 'pytest' and 'pyexpect' to run.
Install them with the following command:
    pip install pytest pyexpect

Then run the file with:
    pytest -xv ex4_tuple_tests.py

You need to implement this code so that all of the tests pass.
Feel free to comment out specific tests, but only submit your answers files.
When checking your answers I will use the test files from this repository.


Tuple (Immutable Container):
    For this introductory lab you need to implement functionality for a basic tuple data structure.
    Performance doesn't matter for this.
    None of the method implementations require more than 6 lines of code.
"""

# IMPLEMENT a TupleException.


# IMPLEMENT a TupleIndexException which inherits from TupleException.


# IMPLEMENT a TupleModifyException which inherits from TupleException.

    A tuple is an immutable data structure which only supports simple operations.
